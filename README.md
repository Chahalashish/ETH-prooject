# description
This smart contract defines a simple token named "tikku" (symbol: "TK") with an initial total supply of 100 tokens. It includes functionality to mint new tokens to an address, burn tokens from an address (if sufficient balance exists), and check the balance of any address. The contract uses a mapping to store balances, ensuring that each address can hold and manage its own tokens. The contract is licensed under the MIT License, allowing for wide usage and modification.
